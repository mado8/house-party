A web application to make hosting music more interactive at social gatherings. Credit to Tech With Tim.

## Description 
This application by Tech With Tim allows the user to create a room with a unique code, using spotify, to share music with friends. This app gives full control of the room settings and music to the host, whereas the guests can be given the opportunity to vote to skip songs, and play/pause music depending on these settings. This application was created using MaterialUI, React, JavaScript, Django, and Python. 

Note:
I have updated the original code by Tech with Tim to include functional components in React rather than Class components, and upgrated to a newer version of React. A skip-previous feature was added as well. Additionally, error handling was added for play/pause and skip features. Last, the backend was improved to keep sensitive data secured.
